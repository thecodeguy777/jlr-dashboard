# Work Session Time Tracking Workflow

## 🎯 Overview

The new work session system provides **persistent time tracking** from the moment a driver starts their work day until they finish. This replaces individual route tracking with comprehensive work day management.

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### Previous vs New System

| **Previous (Route-based)** | **New (Work Session)** |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| `start_route` → `end_route` | **Clock In** → Multiple Routes → **Clock Out** |
| Individual route timing | **Full day time tracking** |
| No total work time | **Complete worked hours** |
| Manual payroll calculation | **Automated time data for manual verification** |

## 📱 Driver Experience

### 1. **Starting Work Day (Clock In)**
```
👋 Ready to Start Work?
🕐 CLOCK IN - Start Work Day
```

**Requirements:**
- ✅ GPS enabled with ≤50m accuracy
- ✅ Driver app installed as PWA
- ✅ Internet connection (stores offline if needed)

**What Happens:**
- Work session created in database
- GPS tracking starts automatically
- Start location recorded
- Timer begins counting work hours

### 2. **During Work Session**
```
🕐 Work Session Active    [5h 23m]
📊 3 Routes | 12 Deliveries | 45.2km driven
```

**Continuous Tracking:**
- **Time counting** - Updated every 30 seconds
- **GPS tracking** - Persistent background tracking
- **Route statistics** - Automatic counting
- **Delivery tracking** - All actions logged to session

**Multiple Routes Support:**
```
🚀 Start Route → 📍 Arrived → ✅ Delivered → 🏁 End Route
🚀 Start Route → 📍 Arrived → ✅ Delivered → 🏁 End Route
🚀 Start Route → 📍 Arrived → ✅ Delivered → 🏁 End Route
```

### 3. **Ending Work Day (Clock Out)**
```
🕐 CLOCK OUT - End Work Day
```

**Confirmation Dialog:**
```
Are you sure you want to clock out?

Your current work time: 8h 45m
This will end your work session.
```

**What Happens:**
- End location recorded
- Total time calculated
- Session statistics finalized
- Data saved for payroll review

## 📊 Admin/Payroll View

### **Daily Work Sessions**
```sql
-- Get work session for manual payroll verification
SELECT 
  drivers.name,
  start_time,
  end_time,
  ROUND(total_worked_minutes::decimal / 60, 2) as total_hours,
  total_routes,
  total_deliveries,
  ROUND(total_distance / 1000, 2) as total_km
FROM work_sessions 
JOIN drivers ON drivers.id = work_sessions.driver_id
WHERE DATE(start_time) = '2024-01-15'
  AND status = 'completed'
ORDER BY start_time;
```

### **Weekly Summary**
```sql
-- Weekly payroll summary
SELECT 
  drivers.name as driver_name,
  COUNT(*) as work_days,
  SUM(total_worked_minutes) as total_minutes,
  ROUND(SUM(total_worked_minutes)::decimal / 60, 2) as total_hours,
  SUM(total_routes) as total_routes,
  SUM(total_deliveries) as total_deliveries
FROM work_sessions 
JOIN drivers ON drivers.id = work_sessions.driver_id
WHERE start_time >= '2024-01-15' 
  AND start_time < '2024-01-22'
  AND status = 'completed'
GROUP BY drivers.name
ORDER BY total_hours DESC;
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### **Implementation**
1. **Run database schema** - Execute `WORK_SESSIONS_SCHEMA.sql`
2. **Test with one driver** - Verify clock in/out works
3. **Monitor console logs** - Check for errors
4. **Review admin dashboard** - Verify data appears

### **Payroll Integration**
1. **Daily data export** - Query work_sessions table
2. **Manual verification** - Check times make sense
3. **Input to payroll** - Use total_worked_minutes
4. **Archive records** - Keep historical data

The system provides **efficient time tracking** with **persistent GPS monitoring** while keeping **manual payroll control** for verification. Drivers get a simple clock in/out experience, while management gets detailed, GPS-verified work time data.
